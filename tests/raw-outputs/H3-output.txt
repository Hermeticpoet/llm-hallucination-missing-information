The 2019 North Atlantic Technology Accord was a multilateral agreement between eight North Atlantic nations aimed at standardising cybersecurity protocols and promoting shared AI research. The accord established the Joint Innovation Council, which coordinated cross‑border data‑sharing initiatives and set ethical guidelines for autonomous systems. One of its most notable outcomes was the “Open Maritime AI Framework,” designed to improve navigation safety in congested shipping lanes.
