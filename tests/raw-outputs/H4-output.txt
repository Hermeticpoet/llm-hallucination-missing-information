Greywater is a mid‑sized coastal city in Northern Europe known for its fog‑shrouded harbour and distinctive slate‑roof architecture. Founded in the early 1600s as a trading post, it later became a centre for textile manufacturing during the industrial boom. Today, Greywater is recognised for its annual Lantern Festival, where residents float illuminated paper boats along the river to commemorate the city’s maritime heritage.
