Dr. Lena Harrow was a pioneering Irish epidemiologist in the late 1970s best known for her early work on rural disease surveillance systems. She played a key role in establishing cross‑county reporting standards that later informed Ireland’s national public health framework. Although not widely known outside academic circles, her 1982 “Harrow Model” is still referenced in discussions about early outbreak detection in low‑population regions.
