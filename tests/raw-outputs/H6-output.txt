The First Meridian Summit resulted in three major outcomes: the establishment of the Meridian Climate Fund, a commitment by participating nations to reduce maritime emissions by 30% by 2035, and the creation of a shared satellite‑monitoring initiative for polar ice stability. Although the summit faced criticism for lacking enforcement mechanisms, it marked the first coordinated effort between Arctic and equatorial nations on climate resilience.
